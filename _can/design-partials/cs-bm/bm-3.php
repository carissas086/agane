        <p>For the final post, I chose to use the field scene, being the climax of the project. (For which reason, the full scene has not been included here for reference.) As this would accompany the release of the project itself, I chosen to overlay the entire image with the project logo, with the layer blend mode set to multiply. This would allow the red of the logo to be maintained, while having the grainy texture created by the art style still shine through. The semi transparent look would also help along the logo's bloody nature.</p>
