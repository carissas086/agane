        <p>These posts were created as a part of a mini self-confidence campaign that we ran on Instagram. The central message was that it is okay to be yourself, as you are. As such, we decided that using photographs of real people would offer a better message for this set of posts.</p>
        <p>Each post therefore featured a stock image, with slight levels adjustments to create a subtle film look. The posts' messages were written in a concise, bold orange statement on a green lower-third like banner so as to catch viewers' attentions as they scrolled through their feed.</p>
