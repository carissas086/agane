                <p>"Letters to Cody: Selena Troyson" was a high-fantasy novel self-published by myself in 2018 under Carrots and Cabbages Inc. The novel featured artwork by <a class="art-link" href="https://www.deviantart.com/tofu-jiggles" target="_blank">Natasha Lee</a>, who drew the characters for this little project as well. Key to the novel were the blue-blood elite of Kaydee High School, 4 of whom were particularly influential to the titular 'Cody Schaffel's life, and therefore where chosen as the central characters around whom the post was based.</p>
                <p>This project was completed following the release of the novel using <span class="bold">Adobe Photoshop</span>.</p>
