                <p>"The Compository" is a fictionary creative photography studio created for a print layout design class during my time at BCIT's New Media Design Program. The name ‘The Compository’ compounds ‘<span class="bold">composite</span>’, as in composite photography, and ‘<span class="bold">repository</span>’, as in something that contains or stores other things.</p>

                    <ol class="li-indent">
                        <li><span class="bold">represent abstract ideas</span> in digestible graphics, and</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">apply designed branding consistently</span> across both print business assets.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Technically, this project highlights my ability with the <span class="bold">Adobe Creative Suite</span> (namely <span class="bold">Illustrator and InDesign</span>). Holistically, what is demonstrated here is an ability to create representative branding that can be consistently applied to both print and online mediums.</p>
