        <p>To kickstart this project, we developed a simple logo, with the intention to develop colours to better brand each individual gallery, instead of the ministry on the whole.</p>

        <p>2 sets of graphics were made in order to announce and promote the first gallery that we were opening. The foundational elements were composited together, and painted over in Adobe Photoshop. This was done deliberately in order to give me as much control over all the graphic elements, and ease the design process as each graphic was to be be done in 5 different form factors.</p>
