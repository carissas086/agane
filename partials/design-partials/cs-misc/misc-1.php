        <p>The concept for this project began with a curious statement often made by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/JosephSo___Library/page/HsewQ0Z5j" target="_blank" title="Joseph's Public Library" class="art-link">Joseph So</a>. As a composer and music producer, Joseph (sometimes adopting the handle 'The Spaceman') would say that he's a musician, whose instrument is 'the computer'. My goal with this project, therefore, was to create a piece that would show what that looks like, to make 'a portrait of the Spaceman'.</p>
        <p>My first task was to sketch out what that would look like. In my initial sketch, I wanted to have him reaching out of one of his music projects for his computer keyboard, MIDI controller in one hand, and surrounded by the things that he often uses to make music. I presented this sketch to him, and got the go-ahead to plan the rest of the shoot.</p>

        <p>Once this was laid out, I did a few quick test shots in Joseph's workspace so that I could plan the shoot day. I noted first that his workspace was incredibly poorly lit, and would therefore need additional lighting, and a good tripod to keep the shots steady and consistent. I also noted that there were elements on his desk that were not necessaryily music production related, however very well encapsulated who he was as a creative mind. I took note of this, and told him in the end to simply have everything that was 'him' on his desk for shoot day.</p>
        <p>The plan for the shoot itself was split into 2 halves: workstation shots, and person shots. I had him lay out his workstation with an empty deskmat first, and took a series of panoramic shots in hopes of compiling them into a wider, higher resolution shot later. This wound up not panning out due to the poor lighting situation, and so the decision to take additional shots of just his desk proved to be incredibly useful.</p>
        <p>As this shoot wound up happening the week of the heatwave in Vancouver, Joseph had an airconditioner set up behind his desk. This would add an additional challenge later in compositing.</p>

    <div class="content-arti-copy">
        <p>Next, I took a number of shots at varying angles of Joseph's effects board, and his hand-build 40% keyboard. Due to the poor lighting in his workspace, we had to move things around in order to ensure that we could get adequate lighting on his equipment.</p>

    <div class="content-arti-copy">
        <p>Next, we took various shots of Joseph himself in the poses that I wanted for the composite. With these, I made an effort to ensure that he was as flatly lit as possible, as I wanted to be able to manipulate the lighting later in post (though this was not the best decision, in hindsight).</p>
        <p>The first was the main shot of him reaching out of his monitor. In order to simulate him reaching out of the monitor, we set up 2 mic stands for him to lean over. Following that were shots of him looking down over a monitor. For this shot, I draped a blue pillowcase over a mic stand in order to help the editing process later, since he was wearing red for that shot. The last shot wound up being of him lying down and playing a mobile game, which I had initially wanted to place on top of his Nintendo Switch.</p>
        <p>With these shots done, I was ready to head into post-production.</p>

        <p>The first step in post-production of the composite was choosing the shots I wanted to use, and cleaning them up to be composited together. I spent several days masking out each of the 6 shots, using a combination of the pen and lasso tools in Photoshop in order to get as clean a selection on each subject as possible. Once this was done, each were placed on the canvas as envisioned.</p>
        <p>This is where the main issue arose. As this shoot happened during an unprecedented heatwave, the entire back wall of Joseph's workstation had to be edited out. While I had initially wanted to simply remove the air conditioner duct, the colour of the wall did not contrast against his hair well, so I decided to set everything against black. Together with the extremely even lighting that I had employed, however, this made the entire shot look unbelievable, and bland.</p>

    <div class="content-arti-copy">
        <p>The first set of edits I did were aimed at adding some environmental fog between every of the 6 shots. These were all hand painted using the brush tool and blur layer effects in Photoshop. These fog layers were masked in order to blend them together as naturally as possible. This served to add more interest and depth to the various layers, and deemphasise the flat black background.</p>
        <p>Also in this set of edits were lighting adjustments made. This was accomplished by painting light in on their own layers, and clipping them to the various photo isolations. This way of working allowed me to work non-destructively, and build up a more natural light scatter pattern throughout the piece. It also allowed me to emphasise the main focal point of the photo.</p>

<div class="content-arti-clean flex flex-end">
    <div class="content-arti-copy">
        <p>Thereafter, I painted in a light beam that would cut across the focal subject's hand, and applied more fog layers around this beam in order to give it a more ethereal look. In order to make the beam more believable, I added in dust particles as well.</p>
        <p>Finally, I applied a series of adjustments to the entire image, pushing the board and the laptop a little further back into the frame, and sharpening the image slightly. Resulting in the final image:</p>

        <p>This project taught me that while planning was important, being willing to pivot, and keep an open mind to better opportunities was also very important. While not exactly as initially sketched, by keeping the idea that I wanted to portray in mind first, rather than the checklist of things to do, I was able to produce a true portrait as I had set out to do.</p>
