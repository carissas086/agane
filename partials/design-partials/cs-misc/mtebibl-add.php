                <p>"Music Between Invisible Boundary Lines", or MTEBIBL for short, was a project created and composed by <span class="bold">Joseph So</span> with artwork by <span class="bold">Anita Ho</span> that I produced for Carrots and Cabbages from 2018-2019. This was meant to be a multi-media project that would offer users an unique music-listening experience, that combines the emotion of music with the visceral experience of art, underscored by a series of conversations between the story's characters.</p>
                <p>As this project was held in development for a year, the project was never completed in its intended form. Instead, the project was released as a playthrough <a class="art-link" href="#">video<a> on YouTube, with all scenes being trigged automatically. The video was edited together by myself in <span class="bold">Davinci Resolve</span> in 2020.</p>
