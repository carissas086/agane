                <p>This project was a part of an assignment for the Illustration in New Media course taken durint BCIT's New Media Design program. It was  completed over 2 weeks in 2021. The goal of the project was to replicate a product mockup completely in 2D vector using <span class="bold">Adobe Illustrator</span>. As an extension of this project, I brought the completed vector illustration into Photoshop in order to generate the banner image for display purposes.</p>
