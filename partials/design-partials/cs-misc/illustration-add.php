                <p>These illustration projects were creative projects that were an extension of coursework done for BCIT's New Media program, or strictly personal projects. They were each completed over the course of several days in 2021.</p>
                <p>Whether the project be derived from coursework or simply from my interest in developing my illustrative skills, creative projects are always an expression of some curiosity. The conception of each project begins with an emotion that wants to be expressed, encapsulated in some figure or character, and then sketched out onto paper before being brought into digital mediums.</p>
                <p>Unless otherwise noted, these were vector illustrations created in <span class="bold">Adobe Illustrator</span> befor being exported and edited in <span class="bold">Photoshop</span>. After which, the final exported image was brought into <span class="bold">Dimension</span> such that a banner image may be rendered.</p>
