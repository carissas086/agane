        <p>In a world where visual storytelling is most prevalent, this project was both fun and a great learning experience. It taught me to widen my perspective on design, to think about how to craft a story out of branding or identity, and how to represent that in design. Crafting vector illustrations has also led me to pursue more projects with a more illustrative foundation.</p>
