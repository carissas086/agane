        <p>As the space was entirely new, we were to create photos that would serve as the foundation of a sort of 'stock photo package' of the space. This required the photos to be:</p>
        <ul class="li-indent bullets">
            <li>adaptable to various marketing use cases</li>
            <li>showcase the various aspects of the space</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of the graphics team, I therefore was heavily involved in the shooting of, and processing of the photos that we took of the space.</p>
