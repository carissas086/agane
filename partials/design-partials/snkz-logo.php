        <p>I wanted to evoke a sense of familiarity with the logo design, leaning on strong geometric shapes largely drawn from the consonants in the brand's name 'SNKZ'. This was accented by a ball, formed with a circle sporting a simple curved line detail. This would speak to the brand's core product, and lift the logo upwards.</p>
        <p>Branding was rounded out with 4 core colours: a bright turquoise, purple, and orange-yellow, and a darker blue-green for contrast. This palette was chosen to bring energy to the brand, and speak to the young demographic.</p>
