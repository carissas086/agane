        <p>The design of this site was designed with the goal to create a site that could be malleable as portfolio pieces were added, while remaining visually simple. To allow the portfolio to adapt as appropriate pieces were added, the gallery was designed to be sectioned thematically, and each artifact page was designed to be adaptable. The site is mobile responsive, largely using the framework bootstrap, and CSS media queries. (Additionally, the gallery's hover effects were removed as they would be missed on a mobile platform.)</p>
