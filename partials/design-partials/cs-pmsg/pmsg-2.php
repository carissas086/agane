        <p>A spread was developed for the client with variations of the logo they selected. The goal of this spread was to show the logo in all the ways that it could be shown:</p>
            <ul class="li-indent bullets">
                <li>just the graphic logo,</li>
                <li>just the wordmark, and</li>
                <li>a combination of both the graphic logo and wordmark.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>In developing variations, I wanted to ensure that the product logos were still consistent aesthetically with the company’s main logo. With this particular variation, the distinguishing feature was the set of lines running across the Pacific Rim shape. The ideology behind these lines were 2-fold:</p>
            <ol class="li-indent">
                <li>to visually establish the company’s identity as a tech company, and</li>
                <li>using lines of progressing width to show growth, and development (alluding to the company’s games being used for education).</li>
            </ol>

        <p>These forward moving lines were the elements that I used to tie these logos together. However, during a follow-up meeting with the client, it was expressed that they liked the image of the dot replaced in the centre of the logo, as though “stepping into the metaverse”. Given this feedback, a second set of variations was developed.</p>

        <p>This set leaned into the centred dot as the key element, and playing with where negative space could be applied to generate variations for the company’s 2 products. Additionally, it was in this spread that I introduced colours, to show the client a variety of colour palettes that could be applied to their brand.</p>
        <p>From here, another conference call with the client, we discovered that the client missed the addition of the horizontals lines in the design, as without, the 3D tech aspect of their game development was lost. As such, a final set was developed with a mix of both lines and solid shapes, with the centred dot remaining the key design element, with the lines being used to generate negative space variations across the logo set.</p>
