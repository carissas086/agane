                <p>Being adaptable to the direction the client wants to go in, and guiding them away from poor design decisions while giving them the control that they ought to have is always central to my approach with client projects.

This relationship that is developed as a result is valuable both to the design process, and to ensuring that the end product is one that the client will love.</p>
