        <p>The goal with this project was to create an illustration that would represent me personally. The piece was inspired by the mobile game 'Monument Valley', and features a little red character in various places on the structure engaging in my various interests. The bulk of the illustration was done primarily with vectors in Adobe Illustrator, with additional post processing in Adobe Photoshop to give the piece more ambience.</p>
