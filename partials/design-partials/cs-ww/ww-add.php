                <p>As a part of an initiative by some members of the worship team, I was asked to make a few graphics and animations to help illustrate some concepts that were being talked about. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUtEu-CA7MSdVP1TKW9R2WsAU_OqQL8Dm" target="_blank" title="FLC Worship Workshop Tools Playlist" class="art-link">These videos</a> were then put up on my church's YouTube channel as a resource for worship leaders and team members looking to go a little more in-depth with music.</p>
                <p>As an extension of that project, I also made a series of infographic-like animations for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ8QsRdxdUY&ab_channel=JosephSo" target="_blank" title="Mother's Day Behind The Scenes Video" class="art-link">a set walk-through</a> that was done by a worship team leader, Joseph So. This video was also uploaded to YouTube, however to his own personal channel.</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, both these mini projects were made through a combination of drawn assets in <span class="bold">Adobe Photoshop</span> and animated in <span class="bold">After Effects</span>, and were completed in 2020 and 2021.</p>
