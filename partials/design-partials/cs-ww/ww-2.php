        <p>This short animation was one of several animated graphics drawn for a video authored by Joseph So as a part of a music education in worship workshop series <a href="#ww-bot" class="art-link">(more information below)</a>. Keeping with Joseph's desired chalkboard aesthetic, I used chalkboard stick figures in a little 2D band setting to illustrate the frustrating scenario he describes.</p>
        <p>The assets for this project were drawn in <span class="bold">Adobe Photoshop</span> and animated in <span class="bold">After Effects</span>.</p>
