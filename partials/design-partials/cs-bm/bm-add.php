                <p>"Black Mansion" is an in-development interactive web project. The project is a narrative experience, in which players explore an abandoned mansion in order to uncover the story of its last occupants. It was created and written by me, with artwork by <a href="https://www.anitartlet.com/" target="_blank" title="Anita's Portfolio" class="art-link">Anita Ho</a> and music by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/JosephSo___Library/page/HsewQ0Z5j" target="_blank" title="Joseph's Public Library" class="art-link">Joseph So</a>. These social media advertising campaign assets, however, were created by myself.</p>
                <p>In creating assets for this project, my goal was to ensure that the unique aesthetic style of the project would echo through to potential end users. The gritty black and white art style, and wandering ambience music was meant to give the experience a feeling of unease, that something was not quite right and needed to be uncovered. This same sense of mystery and history was the guiding principle in the creation of both the teaser videos and the trial instagram posts.</p>
                <p>The <a href="../design/blackmansion-teasers.php" class="art-link">2 motion graphics teasers</a> were completed across a 2 week period each, while the <a href="../design/blackmansion-posts.php" class="art-link">Instagram posts</a> were created within a 1 week period. These assets were all created in 2022.</p>
