        <p>The goal with the Instagram posts was to <span class="bold">hint at the story narrative</span> and to <span class="bold">showcase the project aesthetic</span>. As the black and white style of the artwork was relatively distinctive, I chose to let the artwork shine in making these Instagram posts.</p>
        <p>I chose 3 scenes from the project that would speak to the mansion exploration aspect of the project, and hint at the characters without giving the story away. The goal was to allow the unique artwork draw the viewer in.</p>

        <p>With this first post, I chose a corner of the library scene that featured the broken, battered nature of the abandoned mansion. I overlaid this with the frame drawn by the artist in order to maintain consistency with the project itself.</p>
        <p>After that, I applied a simple level adjustment overlay, and masked out the middle to create a subtle light beam effect. This would draw the eye to the broken glass panes in the scene.</p>
