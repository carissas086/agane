        <p>The concept for this project began with a curious statement often made by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/JosephSo___Library/page/HsewQ0Z5j" target="_blank" title="Joseph's Public Library" class="art-link">Joseph So</a>. As a composer and music producer, Joseph (sometimes adopting the handle 'The Spaceman') would say that he's a musician, whose instrument is 'the computer'. The goal with this project was, therefore, to create a piece that would show what that looks like, to make '<span class="bold">a portrait of the Spaceman</span>'.</p>
