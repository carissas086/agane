        <p>My role within the video half of the project was primarily in the creation of motion graphics for the video. This was broadly broken up into 2 parts:</p>
        <ul class="li-indent bullets">
            <li>3D animated graphics <span class="italics">(done entirely in Blender)</span></li>
            <li>purely text-based motion graphics <span class="italics">(done in Adobe After Effects)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All assets created were handed off to be edited into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGL-l4sZIJ4" target="_blank" title="Final promotional video created" class="art-link">final version of the video</a> and uploaded online.</p>
