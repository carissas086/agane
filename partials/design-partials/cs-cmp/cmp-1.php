        <p>Having consistent company branding across all visual elements of a company is important to showing a professional, unified look and feel to the clients or customers that the company wants to reach. For this project, there were 2 things to keep in focus while designing branding:</p>
        <ul class="li-indent bullets">
            <li>the process of composite photography</li>
            <li>the creativity and whimsy that composite photography enables</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keeping this in mind, I laid out a mood board of imagery that spoke to the feel of the company. Out of this I decided that a muted triadic colour scheme would best reflect a childlike wonder brought into a more subdued, realistic world. Using the primary colours yellow, blue, and red was chosen to reflect the idea of paint, as these primary colours can be mixed to create all other colours, just as composite photography takes elements and brings them together to create anything that you could imagine.</p>
        <p>As for font choices, I tested the name of the company in various fonts, and decided on DeLittle Chromatic Inlay, as the stencil like, halved fonts held the theme of invoking the imagination beyond what the eye can see. Given this highly stylised font choice, I chose a simpler sans serif font that would be easy to read, and modern to look at. There were both fonts chosen out of the Adobe Fonts library so that the fonts could be used both in print and online with ease.</p>

        <p>Initial sketches had me playing around with a camera viewfinder, howwever I quickly found these to be relatively cliched. Sketches from the company's initials were likewise lacklustre. I finally began playing around with the idea of 'thinking out of the box', which I thought was more in line with the company brand. As I sketched in the shape of an eye and an eyeball, I immediately saw how a dynamic logo could be created out of this notion.</p>
        <p>I settled into a logo that shows the whites of an eye, a dark pupil, and a highlight, the latter 2 being represented by simple circles, adjusting their placement to echo the idea of the shapes breaking free. I had the 2 circles lifting up and floating out in an upwards trajectory to the right, and left the bottom piece fully horizontal to represent a sense of grounding. I then applied the 3 branding colours to create the final logo.</p>
