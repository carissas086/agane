        <p>With the basic shapes from the logo in mind, I played around with their size and placement on both the front and back of the business card, going through more literal variations of the logo broken apart, to more playful variations that harken to patterns that one might see on childrenâ€™s upholstery, to more traditional business layouts with strong verticals and horizontals.</p>
        <p>In order to serve the purpose of card and overcome the challenge of its size, I settled on a simpler design that leaned more on the branding colours.</p>
