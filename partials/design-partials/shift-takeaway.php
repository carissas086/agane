        <p>This project was humbling. It required me to go back to the basics, breaking complex shapes and colours down, and finding ways to slowly build them back up using simpler shapes and a combination of multiple gradients and colours, rather than 1 single gradient. Through this project, I found that vectors can be an incredibly powerful tool, and can accomplish visual complexity, opening vectors up as both a creative and nuanced tool for design.</p>
