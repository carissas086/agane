        <p><a href="https://fraserlandsgallery.com" title="Visit Fraser Lands Gallery" target="_blank" class="art-link">Fraser Lands Gallery</a> is an arts ministry at <a href="https://fraserlandschurch.com" title="Visit Fraser Lands Church" target="_blank" class="art-link">Fraser Lands Church</a> that runs a seasonal art gallery. These galleries would be launched three times a year, collecting artwork done by members of the church in various mediums. Each of these galleries would have a different theme (the first of which was themed for Christmas).</p>
        <p>My role in the project was to serve as both a <span class="bold">graphics designer</span> and as a <span class="bold">web developer</span>. This would entail creating a website that could archive artwork, as well as designing all needed graphics for the project. I remain also responsible for the site's maintenance, and continue to develop new features for the site, the latest of which was support for themes changing with  each gallery.</p>
