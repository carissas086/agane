        <p><a href="https://fraserlandsgallery.com" title="Visit Fraser Lands Gallery" target="_blank" class="art-link">Fraser Lands Gallery</a> is an arts ministry at <a href="https://fraserlandschurch.ca" title="Visit Fraser Lands Church" target="_blank" class="art-link">Fraser Lands Church</a> that runs a seasonal art gallery. These galleries would be launched three times a year, collecting artwork done by members of the church in various mediums for a (primarily) physical showcase at the church. Each of these would have a different theme.</p>
        <p>My role in the project was to:</p>
        <ul class="li-indent bullets">
            <li><span class="bold">create branding</span> for the project that could adapt to each gallery's theme,</li>
            <li><span class="bold">design &amp; code</span> a website that could archive artwork, and</li>
            <li><span class="bold">design</span> graphics to promote the gallery's opening night</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first of these galleries would be Christmas themed.</p>
