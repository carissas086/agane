        <p>After initial ideation and sketching, a photoshoot was done to get the elements that I needed for the project. This included shots of Joseph's workstation, his hand-build 40% mechanical keyboard, and effects board, as well as 3 individual shots of Joseph himself to composite into the photo.</p>
