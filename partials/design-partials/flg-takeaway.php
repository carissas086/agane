        <p>Though simple in theory, the complexities of this project lay in the adaptability that needed to be built into each aspect of it. This brought a new dimension to the project, and became an important practice of adaptability and creative thinking. As the needs of the project must always come first, each step of this project was solving problems not only in the present, but to anticipate ones that may come as the project expands, and putting systems in place to accommodate them.</p>
        <p>Personally, being a part of this project has been an incredibly meaningful experience for me. As the project continues, I'll continue to refine the site's features to allow it to scale, and strive to innovate as we design future galleries.</p>
