        <p>I started this project by designing a front decal that would be able to accomodate various coffee roast names. This was important to me so that I would be able to consolidate the brand logo and key information into a single element. This would form the core feature of the packaging design.</p>
        <p>After these, I designed 2 package backgrounds for the 2 flavours of coffee that I would be mocking up. These were a light and a dark background utilising brand colours. This would afford me the additional challenge of dealing with varying contrasts on the bean packages, and ensure that this packaging design would be useable across any future package variation.</p>

        <p>As I knew I would only be mocking up the package fronts, these were the only assets that would be required for the mockup. I exported these assets, and brought them into Adobe Dimension for the mockup. The background was applied of a basic coffee beans package model, and the decal positioned on the front. This mocked up model was duplicated, and the background and decal replaced for the second flavour.</p>
        <p>As an extension to this project, the mockup was exported as a Photoshop file, and further mocked up into a banner advert in Photoshop.</p>
        <p>This project was my first venture into product mockup through <span class="bold">Adobe Dimension</span>. Given the functionality to create variations easily, the challenge I chose to tackle with this project was to create a design that could easily support variations in colour and name, despite a relatively complex brand logo.</p>
        <p>This project was completed in <span class="bold">Adobe Illustrator</span> and <span class="bold">Dimension</span>, with the additional banner mocked up in <span class="bold">Adobe Photoshop</span>.</p>
