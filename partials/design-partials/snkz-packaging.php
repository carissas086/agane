        <p>The shoebox design is anchored in geometric shapes that echo the branding. The box itself features a ring of odd-shaped polygons, encircling the bottom of the box to give it energy and suggest movement. The box is accented by the design that runs around the edge of the lid. This enforces the boldness of the brand, utilising the strong contrast offered by the logo's geometric shapes organised on the dark blue-green background.</p>
        <p>The design was mocked up on a simple shoebox modelled in Blender, and set in a basketball court with a simple animation as the foundation for marketing purposes.</p>

    data-title="The box design features polygons of the brand's core colours. These are set on a simple off-white background with a sparse spotted triangles design. This background is meant to echo an elementary school vinyl flooring pattern, such as in a multi-purpose room, since the youthful demographic that the brand targets would likely have begun learning sports and games in such a setting." >
