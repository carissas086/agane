        <p>As a part of the project, we created Facebook events throughout the course of the term, for which several graphics were also made. For our halloween event, I used graphics similar to the style I had found for the Instagram postings so as to create some continuity between the various social media channels. This was then masked, and rotated to an angle to give the post a little more of a fun look.</p>

        <p>For the fictional pet adoption event, I had initially intended on having the pets looking up at the event name, as if looking forward to it's coming. However, in looking through stock images I found instead an image of a cat and dog looking around a white wall. This because the perfect staging area for a sort of spray paint aesthetic, with the event title being revealed in the middle instead, giving the image fun texture and a cute theme.</p>
