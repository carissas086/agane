                <p>These 2 sets of marketing banners were created for a Marketing class assignment as part of the New Media Design program and BCIT. We were tasked to choose 2 real companies for which to create marketing banners. These companies were chosen due to my personal connection, having trained at Origins Parkour for a number of years, and having supported Extra Life donation drives in the past.</p>
                <p>These banners were created with stock assets and assets taken from the company's respective sites, and designed in <span class="bold">Adobe Photoshop</span>.</p>
                <p>NOTE: <span class="bold italic">These banners were created for educational purposes only, and do not represent these companies in any way.</span> </p>
