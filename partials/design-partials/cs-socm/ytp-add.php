                <p>Youthe Power was a fictional youth center created by myself, <a href="https://jaymehill.ca" target="_blank" class="art-link">Jayme Hill</a>, and Tammy Ho for a social media project during the latter half of 2021 for our social media class in BCIT's New Media program. The centre was focused on creating a welcoming space for youths, and so the social media posts were more light-hearted and uplifting in  nature. My part in the project revolved around coding the project website, and creating post graphics and copy for the project, as detailed above.</p>
